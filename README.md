# screenlock_koreader_plugin
This is a small plugin to enable locking the screen of the KOReader.

Just put screenlock.koplugin into the kodreader/plugins directory.

Change the hardcoded password at the top of the main.lua from 1234 to something else.

The plugin will automatically activate on resume from suspend. There is also a screenlock menu entry added.
